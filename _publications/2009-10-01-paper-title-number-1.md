This log is the first log about the basic information for the fundamental simulator . The second is left for future work.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation is gaining more and more interest in both research and business. Real UAV experiments could be expensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, the validation and testing of UAV navigational algorithms using simulation is essential in the early phases of development when it is difficult to get high-precision and high-fidelity experiment data. In this proposal, we provide a framework for a visual navigational validation environment for unmanned aerial vehicles based on ROS2, PX4, and Gazebo. When implemented, the suggested simulator can provide non- expert end-users with a modular simulation environment that is faster and more reliable for verifying and advancing proposed UAV navigation solutions, such as visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms.
