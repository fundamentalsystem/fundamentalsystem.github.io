Secondary development, also known as software maintenance, is an important part of the software development process. It involves making changes and improvements to an existing software system, in order to fix bugs, add new features, or improve performance.

There are several reasons why software may need secondary development:

- To fix bugs and errors: As software is used, it may encounter unexpected problems or errors that need to be fixed in order to ensure that it continues to function properly.
- To add new features and functionality: As user needs and requirements change, the Fundamental System may need to be updated to include new features and capabilities.
- To improve performance and scalability: As more users adopt the software, it may need to be optimized to handle increased usage and workload.
- To maintain compatibility with other systems and technologies: As the software ecosystem evolves, the Fundamental System may need to be updated to maintain compatibility with other systems and technologies.
- To keep the Fundamental System up to date and secure: As new security threats emerge, the Fundamental System may need to be updated to protect against these threats and ensure that it remains secure.

Overall, secondary development is necessary to ensure that the Fundamental System continues to function effectively and meet the needs of users.
