Software Requirement Specification (SRS) is a document that describes the requirements and constraints of a software system. It is an important part of the software development process, as it provides a clear and detailed description of what the software should do and how it should behave.

There are several reasons why SRS is important and useful in software engineering:

- It helps to define the scope and objectives of the software project, providing a clear understanding of what the software should do and what it should not do.
- It serves as a contract between the development team and the customer, outlining the requirements and constraints that the software must meet.
- It provides a common understanding of the software requirements among all stakeholders, including developers, customers, and other interested parties.
- It serves as a basis for the design and development of the software, providing a roadmap for the development team to follow.
- It helps to identify any potential risks or issues with the software requirements, allowing the development team to address them early in the development process.
- It provides a reference point for evaluating the final software, to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and constraints.

Overall, SRS is a valuable tool for defining and documenting the requirements for a software system and is an essential part of the software development process.

Therefore, we present the SRS draft [here](../files/paper1) for further refinement and reference.
